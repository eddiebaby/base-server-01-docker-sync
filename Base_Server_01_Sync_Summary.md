# Base Server 01 Docker Synchronization Summary

This document provides a summary of the Docker synchronization setup for Base Server 01.

## Overview

The Docker synchronization setup allows you to maintain identical Docker environments across multiple machines. This is particularly useful for development, testing, and deployment scenarios where consistency is critical.

## Files Created

The following files have been created to facilitate Docker synchronization:

1. **Docker Sync Setup Guide.md**
   - Comprehensive documentation on Docker synchronization
   - Includes detailed instructions for all synchronization operations
   - Covers troubleshooting and advanced configuration

2. **enable_docker_remote.ps1**
   - PowerShell script to enable Docker remote access
   - Configures Docker daemon to accept remote connections
   - Sets up Windows Firewall rules
   - Provides connection information for remote access

3. **sync_base_server_image.ps1**
   - PowerShell script for Base Server image synchronization
   - Allows saving and loading Docker images
   - Provides container creation and management
   - Includes error handling and user prompts

4. **desktop_sync_base_server.ps1**
   - PowerShell script specifically for desktop synchronization
   - Streamlined workflow for setting up on a desktop machine
   - Includes file copying with progress indication
   - Provides container setup and configuration

5. **docker_sync_quickstart.ps1**
   - Quick start PowerShell script for Docker synchronization
   - Simplified interface for common operations
   - Ideal for users who need a straightforward approach
   - Includes default settings for Base Server 01

6. **sync_docker_env.bat**
   - Batch file for Docker environment synchronization
   - Provides a menu-driven interface
   - Includes all synchronization operations
   - Works on Windows without PowerShell requirements

## Usage Workflow

### Source Machine (Saving)

1. Run `sync_docker_env.bat` or `sync_base_server_image.ps1`
2. Choose the option to save the Docker image
3. Specify the image name (default: base_server_01)
4. Specify the output path for the image file
5. Wait for the image to be saved

### Target Machine (Loading)

1. Copy the image file to the target machine
2. Run `sync_docker_env.bat`, `desktop_sync_base_server.ps1`, or `docker_sync_quickstart.ps1`
3. Choose the option to load the Docker image
4. Specify the path to the image file
5. Wait for the image to be loaded
6. Create and start a container from the image

### Remote Access (Optional)

1. Run `enable_docker_remote.ps1` as Administrator
2. Follow the prompts to configure Docker for remote access
3. Note the IP address and port for connecting remotely

## Testing

To verify the synchronization:

1. Run `sync_docker_env.bat`
2. Choose the option to test Docker synchronization
3. The script will check:
   - If Docker is running
   - If the container exists
   - If the container is running
   - The container's health status
   - Port mappings
   - Command execution within the container

## Next Steps

After synchronizing the Docker environment:

1. Access the Base Server 01 application at http://localhost:5001 (or the configured port)
2. Verify that all functionality is working as expected
3. Configure any environment-specific settings
4. Begin using the synchronized environment for development, testing, or deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Docker logs: `docker logs base_server_01_instance`
2. Verify Docker is running: `docker info`
3. Check container status: `docker ps -a`
4. Ensure ports are not in use by other applications
5. Refer to the Docker Sync Setup Guide for detailed troubleshooting steps

## Maintenance

To keep the environments synchronized:

1. Regularly save updated images on the source machine
2. Transfer and load the updated images on target machines
3. Recreate containers as needed
4. Test functionality after each synchronization
